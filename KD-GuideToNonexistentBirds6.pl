/*
 * THE GUIDE TO NONEXISTENT BIRDS - AN ORNITHOLOGICAL LOGIC
 * Edited by Kavi Duvvoori
 *
 *
 *
 * (How I would recommend reading this thing, though there is room for
 * debate on this question - read the Neruda poem, all the comments I
 * wrote (I'm attached to a few of them), the Wallace Stevens in its
 * entirety but only once, skip the Keats except for a few lines for
 * atmosphere, the Bukowski won't take up too much of your time (the
 * poems are included not because i think they're the very best bird
 * related poems there are but because maybe they somehow help develop
 * the narrative), skim 13 or so birds, and don't bother with the code
 * except for a few carefully named variables; it's up to you what to do
 * with the rest of it)
 *
 *
 *
 * BIRD
 * Pablo Neruda
 *
 * It was passed from one bird to another,
 * the whole gift of the day.
 * The day went from flute to flute,
 * went dressed in vegetation,
 * in flights which opened a tunnel
 * through which the wind would pass
 * to where birds were breaking open
 * the dense blue air -
 * and there, night came in.
 *
 * When I returned from so many journeys,
 * I stayed suspended and green
 * between sun and geography -
 * I saw how wings worked,
 * how perfumes are transmitted
 * by feathery telegraph,
 * and from above I saw the path,
 * the springs and the roof tiles,
 * the fishermen at their trades,
 * the trousers of the foam;
 * I saw it all from my green sky.
 * I had no more alphabet
 * than the swallows in their courses,
 * the tiny, shining water
 * of the small bird on fire
 * which dances out of the pollen

% To identify a bird quickly, note the shape of the wings in profile,

% forget the ruffle of feathers, but maybe count a flock; dappled
% sunlight is distracting but removing it, as painters but not
% cameras do, the distinction between speckled and striped is a good
% way to tell thrush from thrush; the difference, between 2 and 5 cm, in
% the length of a white brow stripe can identify Siberian from East
% Asian variants of a swallow; plumage patterns of the juvenile are
% different and require another chart.

/*
 * THIRTEEN WAYS OF LOOKING AT A BLACKBIRD
 * Wallace Stevens
 *
 * I
 * Among twenty snowy mountains,
 * The only moving thing
 * Was the eye of the blackbird.
 *
 * II
 * I was of three minds,
 * Like a tree
 * In which there are three blackbirds
 *
 * III
 * The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.
 * It was a small part of the pantomime.
 *
 * IV
 * A man and a woman are one.
 * A man and a woman and a
 * blackbird
 * Are one.
 *
 * V
 * I do not know which to prefer,
 * The beauty of inflections
 * Or the beauty of innuendoes,
 * The blackbird whistling
 * Or just after.
 *
 * VI
 * Icicles filled the long window
 * With barbaric glass.
 * The shadow of the blackbird
 * Crossed it, to and fro.
 * The mood
 * Traced in the shadow
 * An indecipherable cause.
 *
 * VII
 * O think men of Haddam,
 * Why do you imagine golden birds?
 * Do you not see how the blackbird
 * Walks around the feet
 * Of the women about you
 *
 * VIII
 * I know noble accents
 * And lucid, inescapable rhythms;
 * But I know, too,
 * That the blackbird is involved
 * In what I know.
 * ...
 *
 * (same conflicts and confusions present themselves in VII; the same
 * easy and unsatisfying answers (new beaks))

% Ode to a Nightingale
%    John Keats
%
% My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
%    My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
% Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
%    One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
% 'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot
%    But being too happy in thine happiness,-
%       That though, light-winged Dryad of the trees
%          In some melodious plot
%	Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,
%	   Singest of summer in full-throated ease.
%
% O, for a drought of vintage! that hath been
%    Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,
% Tasting of Flora and the country green,
%    Dance, and Provencal song, and sunburnt mirth!
% O for a beaker full of the warm South,
%    Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,
%       With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,
%          And purple-stained mouth;
%    That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,
%       And with thee fade away into the forest dim:
%
% Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget
%    What thou among the leaves hast never known,
% The weariness, the fever, and the fret
%    Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;
% Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,
%    Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;
%       Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
%          And leaden-eyed despairs,
%	Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,
%	  Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.
%
% Away! away! for I will fly to thee,
%    Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,
% But on the viewless wings of Poesy,
%    Though the dull brain perlexes and retards:
% Already with thee! tender is the night,
%    And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,
%       Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays;
%          But here there is no light,
%    Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
%       Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways
%
% I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,
%    Now what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,
% But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet
%    Wherewith the seasonable month endows
% The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;
%    White hawthorn and the pastoral eglantine;
%       Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves;
%          And mid-May's eldest child,
%    The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,
%       The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.
%
% Darkling I listen; and, for many a time
%    I have been half in love with easeful Death,
% Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme,
%    To take into the air my quiet breath;
%       Now more then ever seems it rich to die,
%    To cease upon the midnight with no pain,
%       While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
%          In such an ecstasy!
%    Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain-
%       To thy high requiem become a sod.
%
% Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!
%    No hungry generations thread thee down;
% The voice I hear this passing night was heard
%    In ancient days by emperor and clown:
% Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
%    Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,
%       She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
%          The same that oft-times hath at intervels.
%
%
%    Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam
%       Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn.
%
% Forlorn! the very word is like a bell
%    To toll me back from thee to my sole self!
% Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well
%    As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf.
% Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades
%    Past the near meadows, over the still stream,
%       Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep
%          In the next valley-glades:
%    Was it a vision, or a waking dream?
%       Fled is that music:-Do I wake or sleep?

% How can we direct the next wave to splash our cousin's face?

/*
 * THIRTEEN WAYS OF LOOKING AT A BLACKBIRD
 * Wallace Stevens
 *
 * I
 * Among twenty snowy mountains,
 * The only moving thing
 * Was the eye of the blackbird.
 *
 * II
 * I was of three minds,
 * Like a tree
 * In which there are three blackbirds
 *
 * III
 * The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.
 * It was a small part of the pantomime.
 *
 * IV
 * A man and a woman
 * Are one.
 * A man and a woman and a blackbird
 * Are one.
 *
 * V
 * I do not know which to prefer,
 * The beauty of inflections
 * Or the beauty of innuendoes,
 * The blackbird whistling
 * Or just after.
 *
 * VI
 * Icicles filled the long window
 * With barbaric glass.
 * The shadow of the blackbird
 * Crossed it, to and fro.
 * The mood
 * Traced in the shadow
 * An indecipherable cause.
 *
 * VII
 * O think men of Haddam,
 * Why do you imagine golden birds?
 * Do you not see how the blackbird
 * Walks around the feet
 * Of the women about you
 *
 * VIII
 * I know noble accents
 * And lucid, inescapable rhythms;
 * But I know, too,
 * That the blackbird is involved
 * In what I know.
 *
 * IX
 * When the blackbird flew out of sight,
 * It marked the edge
 * Of one of many circles.
 *
 * X
 * At the sight of blackbirds
 * Flying in green light,
 * Even the bawds of euphony
 * Would cry out sharply.
 *
 * XI
 * He rode over Connecticut
 * In a glass coach.
 * Once, a fear pierced him,
 * In that he mistook
 * The shadow of his equipage
 * For blackbirds.
 *
 * XII
 * The river is moving.
 * The blackbird must be flying.
 *
 * XIII
 * It was evening all afternoon.
 * It was snowing
 * And it was going to snow.
 * The blackbird sat
 * In the cedar-limbs.

% Don't ask me about existent birds though. I own the latest

% and never got around to making up the reading. I did like birds of

% Caged Bird
% BY MAYA ANGELOU
%
% A free bird leaps
% on the back of the wind
% and floats downstream
% till the current ends
% and dips his wing
% in the orange sun rays
% and dares to claim the sky.
%
% But a bird that stalks
% down his narrow cage
% can seldom see through
% his bars of rage
% his wings are clipped and
% his feet are tied
% so he opens his throat to sing.
%
% The caged bird sings
% with a fearful trill
% of things unknown
% but longed for still
% and his tune is heard
% on the distant hill
% for the caged bird
% sings of freedom.
%
% The free bird thinks of another breeze
% and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees
% and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn
% and he names the sky his own
%
% But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams
% his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream
% his wings are clipped and his feet are tied
% so he opens his throat to sing.

% Beginning early with an odd bird in the hand, one free in the sheet of
% the sky, or two on the wire.
%
%-
%
% What i am writing about is that i go home, and the next morning we go
% on a hike up the local public park mountain and what we do is carry a
% laminated guide to local wildflowers and at each new blossom stop and
% cluster around the pictures looking at the yellow white purple orange
% or red petals comparing and looking at leaf lengths and saying into
% the wind "California Milkworth," "Purple Larkspur," "Baby Blue Eyes,"
% "Mugwort," "Morning Glory," "Fiddleneck," "Yellow Monkeyflower,"
% "Linseed"
%
%-
%
% In the blurb of Inger Christensen's /Alphabet/, someone calls her a
% "singer of syllables." That's one thing i believe in i guess, the
% saying of the names of things as a kind of prayer or assurance of your
% place among them and towards no other end, to speak in clicking
% noun-phrases and breathing infinitives while walking through both the
% landscape and the words for it.
%
% There is that classic sort of wizardry that operates by knowing and
% speaking, as distinguished from simply recalling and recreating the
% sounds of, names. From Ursula Le Guin's /Earthsea/ for instance "My
% name, and yours, and the true name of the sun, or a spring of water,
% or an unborn child, all are syllables of the great word that is very
% slowly spoken by the shining of the stars. There is no other power. No
% other name." Something else i like about this kind of Young Adult
% wizardry is the suspicion of the power in it: how the knowledge of a
% person's actual name gives a total and dangerous kind of control over
% them; the namer of birds, there, is a maker of lists but also
% responsible for the unpredictable and at times incendiary or
% entrapping results of speaking their grimoire.
%
%-
%
% Code is language that does fixed things.
%
% Code is not what this is about but it is one of the things that it is
% about because, for all of programming's silliness obscurity and
% economics, in its sentences one can glimpse every now and then,
% through the For loops and cautious architectures of parenthesis,
% inside the obscure formal spacing and odd capitalization, traces of
% the old original magic: words, utterances that some opaque and not
% human thing hears and responds to.
%
% The rhetoric of almost all programming is the rhetoric of either the
% imperative or of the declarative: in the first the programmer tells
% their variables what they are, what they will do, what they will
% mutate into, and eventually how they will be written or acted upon;
% functional programming describes how one sort of code-thing makes
% another code-thing, and writes the rules for these subtle growths and
% transformations until one finds themselves writing rules about rules,
% and rules about rules about rules. Logic programming however, as this
% document mostly is, is an attempt at a third approach: in Prolog one
% describes a system of things, and if this constructed place is a
% possible one the interpreter finds it, assembles the pieces from
% basic blocks, and shows you the discovered landscape.
%
%-
%
% Consider an eccentric, aspiring, and trust-fund supported
% ornithologist who absolutely refuses to step out of their room.
%
% Birds occasionally fly past their window or rest on a distant branch,
% but each too quickly or at just too much of a distance for the
% Ornithologist At Their Window to do more than observe one feature or a
% rough outline of.
%
% This eccentric however feels for whatever reason compelled to sit for
% hours daily at their desk with a pen and a notebook, assembling these
% remembered fragments into descriptions of the birds which they imagine
% they might have seen. They might tell the way a blue neck inflates and
% contracts over indigo wings, or the three syllable screeching of
% certain hawks. It is important for this story that the only way we can
% write about this author is to talk about how they write their
% ornithology; much later, someone finds the enormous stack of notebooks
% they leave behind containing nothing but potential birds. The contents
% of their notebooks are published on someone else's whim.
%
% Now imagine walking outside with this guide, down to the slough in
% Spring or into hills, and seeing a bird on a branch of an oak, or
% wading through the muck.
%
% You open the Book of Potential Birds and flip for a while through
% its exhaustive pages, learning to navigate its oddly ordered
% sections. The bird is in no rush to get anywhere else, has a long
% stripe accross its torso, and hobbles and bobs along. Now you find an
% entry in the book that - though its author never saw the bird in front
% of you, describes exactly its size, motion, and one stripe. The book
% tells you the bird makes a harsh and doubled whistling; this time,
% the bird you are watching a body's length away makes a harsh and
% doubled whistling.
%
%-
%
% There are birds in the backyard: after metaphor, fact and background
% noise.
%
% Over fig blossoms a green one is humming, still as the landscape moves
% around it.
%
% On the fence at the back of the property, seen through the leaves of
% the apricot tree are three gray and brown animals, to my untrained
% eyes the only description for their shape "bird": a doubly bent curve,
% simple beak, a bulge and suggestion of wings, the thin toes wrapped
% round wood and the paper fan of tail behind. Their heads and torsos
% turn occasionally and at once; they strut along the walk. They
% pause. Then, they fly up at my approach and land back three feet
% further down along the wood.
%
% Two sleek and brown-chested specimens pick at the fallen apricots or
% the grubs buried in the fruits opened orange matter.
%
% One small and dark and gray thrashes around somehow within air, as if
% touching and thrown back by invisible walls which its wings find and
% shove.
%
% A long way up two bent flecks, making somewhere small running shadows,
% drift.
%
% Another bird with a dark crest, white neck, neatly splayed tail,
% the kind of bird for the birdwatchers or the hikers at their cameras,
% rests a few moments in another long-leaved tree, before setting the
% branch vibrating as the blur of it dives up and swims in air.
%
% The background noise, as it almost invariably is, is a range of bird
% whistles, chirps, and chittering - the apparent peaks each with their
% own jagged and private contour - that stand against each other; now a
% wail that comes in threes, rising, dropping, while from another ear's
% side of the yard a full paragraph of evenly spaced and paper-thin
% notes scatters, with an undertone of insects vibrating and, if you
% listen very carefully, the refrigerator.
%
% -
%
% There is a 13 paragraph story-shaped hole here, and what i am doing is
% looking for the noises or meanings that could succesfully fill out or
% scaffold it; reaching for birds: consider a landscape the birds have
% deserted - electric wires just strings sagging their symmetric natural
% sag, braches and leaves that jiggle predictably to wind, fences which
% designate boundaries and have nothing to interrupt their tops.
%
% The topography of this birdless place is the same as it was, more or
% less, but the place somehow seems empty as a page, as though it was
% existing before to hold birds, as though while watching this landscape
% you are really waiting for the birds and their utterances to inhabit
% it, and are now looking for where they will enter it again: on the
% branches, along the fence, or clutching the wire.
%
% Maybe birds are parralel and alternate societies, civilizations we
% look into to restructure or make contingent ours: buildings of rooks,
% and coveys of partridges; murmurations of starlings, casts of hawks,
% and the inevitable murders of crows; some parliaments of owls, and a
% watch of nightingales. To sit in the parliamentary chamber observing
% unceasing arguments in an unspoken language.
%
% Alternately, maybe single birds are instead examples of the
% metamorphosed bodies an inacessible person becomes: the understanding
% of herons and cruelty of ravens; wisdom of owls, grace of swans, and
% morbid despair of vultures. The way the animal cannot protest the
% story told of it without its call being made back into story, or to
% praise.
%
% Something else i like and look for is the moment when a metaphor gets
% so involved in its details that it no longer appears to be a map to
% somewhere else, but its own place - parables that get lost in
% themselves, like Aesop's Fables or Calvino's /Cosmicomics/; i believe
% in maps, in the possibility of paraphrase - that, at the end of the
% day, our explanations usually can do what we need them to - but also
% that there is something else to be found in the contour of the drawn
% coastline, a way in which the pencil finding the inlets and little
% islands also begins to undertand the possible joy and reasons behind
% its own motion. I think one could read The Sibley Guide to Birds,
% as a magic-realist collection of prose-poetry now, if there were no
% birds around at all.
%
% 'Consider a language-game between a birdwatcher A and a
% nature photographer B. A is photographing birds: there are grebes,
% thrushes, swallows, and wrens. B has to find and name the birds in the
% order in which A wants to photograph them. For this purpose, they use
% a language consisting of the words "grebe," "thrush," "swallow," and
% "wren." A calls them out; B finds and points to the bird they have
% learned to find at such-and-such a call. Concieve this as a complete
% primitive language.' Consider a sendentary creature who returns
% through all seasons to the same three or four perches (i'm trying to
% avoid autobiography, but only find myself explaining what i imagine i
% do and do not understand of myself).
%
% Raymond Queneaus motto: "Rats who build the labyrinth from which they
% will try to escape"
%
% Georges Perec's: "I set myself rules in order to be totally free"
%
% This is not the logic of birds of course, but the logic of a mind
% making a logic for the birds already in its private landscape: i do
% not hope to find the actual patterns of ornithology, but only to
% consider some of the odd extravagant and particular birds of a logic;
% it is not the still polygon of the stuffed specimen but the blur of
% the hovering hummingbird's wings that i want to watch and understand:
% or maybe what is interesting is actually the counterpoint between
% polygon and motion.
%
% I do remember walking through the coastal forest where an osprey was
% and the binoculars on a string around my neck. I do not really
% remember the bird beyond the flash of some section of white and the
% signification of wings, but i remember talking and reading about it
% afterwards, in our place a rare bird, fish-eater and diver, nesting
% on large sticks placed in a dead tree. I remember kestrels on
% telephone wires and boring vultures. A hawk or swift that one morning
% we found after a thunderclap from the living room window: shaking in a
% pile there for some minutes as we wondered whether there was someone
% one is supposed to call about dying birds, when it gathered itself up
% and flapped off.
%
% A speculation (not true or untrue but perhaps with the sound of
% potentially resonant things, that can catch and keep an ear for the
% duration of their utterance and which later a mouth may find itself
% repeating a variation on): birdsong is the place where names and
% things line up; where, for the length of such a song, the landscape
% and its language can be figure and ground of the same place; a
% rabbit running from the hawk's shadow, the hawk directing the
% darkening of grass after the rabbit.
%
% You are taking a break now, finding a window, finding the bird in it,
% giving it a minute, coming back after.
